%G_SEGMENTS Extract segments from an edge image
%   S = G_SEGMENTS(E,MAXDIST,MINLONG) Return a matrix S with the following structure
%        Column 1    Label of the segment.
%        Column 2    i coor. of the begin point.
%        Column 3    j coor. of the begin point.
%        Column 4    i coor. of the end point.
%        Column 5    j coor. of the end point.
%   
%   MAXDIST     Max. distance between pixels in the edge image and segments
%   MINLONG     Min. long. in pixels of segments
%
%   Example
%   -------
%       I = g_pgmload('telephonel.pgm');
%       E = g_canny(I,2,100,100);
%       S = g_segments(E,1.5,20);
%       g_imsplot(I,S,'ip','blue');
