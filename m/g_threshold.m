function T = g_threshold(I,THRESHOLD)
%G_THRESHOLD Apply a threshold to a given matrix
%   T = G_THRESHOLD(I,THRESHOLD) return a matrix of the same size
%   as I with elements greater than THRESHOLD.
%
%   THRESHOLD  Threshold value
%
%   Example
%   -------
%       I = pgmread('cartl.pgm');
%       T = g_threshold(I,150);
%       image(T),colormap(gray(256))
